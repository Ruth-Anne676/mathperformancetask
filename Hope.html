<p> A dove is one of the symbols for hope. It is mentioned in children's books and even the bible. In this Performance task, we try to show how a single picture can give hope. Hope a small word but makes a big difference. Hope is what we need especially since the pandemic took a toll on us. From unemployement, closing of schools and self-quarintine, we should have hope and not give up. Let us continue to fight and pray for guidance</p>
